# Titanic dataset - Exploratory data analysis
This file contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the Titanic Dataset. The objective of this project is to explore, clean, visualize, and understand the dataset to identify patterns and relationships that could help in predicting passenger survival.

# Dataset Source

Source: Kaggle - Titanic Dataset

# Features Description

Survived: 0 = No, 1 = Yes 
Pclass: Passenger class (1, 2, 3) 
Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked, etc.

# Techniques Used

Summary Statistics (.describe()) 
Null value handling (.isnull().sum()) 
Outlier detection (IQR method, Boxplots) 
Countplots, Histograms, KDE plots 
Correlation matrix and Heatmaps 
Pairplots to compare numerical features with Survived

# Sample Visualizations

Countplot: Distribution of survivors 
Boxplot: Age distribution by survival status 
Heatmap: Feature correlations 
Pairplot: Pairwise relationships in dataset.
